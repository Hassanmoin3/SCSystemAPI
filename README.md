# Supermarket Product Detection using YOLO

## Introduction
The Supermarket Product Detection project aims to automate the identification of supermarket products using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm. The system is trained on a dataset of 20 different supermarket products and offers a real-time detection solution.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- YOLO v4/v5 (for object detection)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your YOLO version)

## Features
- Real-time supermarket product detection
- Trained on 20 distinct supermarket products
- High accuracy and low latency
- Easy integration into retail management systems

## Dataset
The model is trained on a curated dataset comprising images of 20 different supermarket products. The dataset is rigorously annotated to ensure the highest detection accuracy.

## YOLO Architecture
The YOLO algorithm is utilized for its effectiveness in real-time object detection, high accuracy, and the ability to detect multiple objects simultaneously.

## Installation
To clone and run this project, execute the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SupermarketProductDetection.git
cd SupermarketProductDetection
pip install -r requirements.txt
